# Proof of Æxistence
This is a click dummy for the Proof of Æxistence æpp.

It provides a easey to use interface to create hashes of files and store them on the aeternity blockchain inside of a smart contract as a undeniable proof a file existed at a certain time in the past.

Due to the immutable nature of blockchains, the proof stays public on the blockchain even if this æpp ceases to exist.

The purpose of this dummy is to show how aeterntiy envisions user friendly blockchain applications.

All features are subject to improvement and change. Feel free to leave suggestions in the issues.
